                <h1>Central Library</h1>
                <p>The Central Library is one of the key central facilities of the Institute. The primary goal of the
                    Library is to
                    support the educational, research and innovation programs of the Institute by providing physical and
                    digital access
                    to intellectual information.
                    The Library is well-managed and acts as the knowledge hub of the entire Institute. It has a rich and
                    comprehensively
                    high quality of information resources in the field of Science and Technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The new building is planned on modular principles based on the requirements of the Institute
                    Library. It has three
                    spacious floors. The new Library building is centrally air-conditioned and occupied with three lifts
                    operating in
                    the building. For better security, the library building is integrated with RFID system, CCTV camera
                    and fire alarm
                    system.
